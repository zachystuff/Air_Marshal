You awake from a daze with the taste of whiskey in your breath. Looking around you notice you are on board a plane.
As you stare around you start looking in your pockets, in them, you find a badge that reads 'Air Marshal' and a phone.

Upon further inspection of the phone you notice there is an unread message. You read the message and it  says:
    "We have received intel that a crime will be committed before the flight lands.
     It is up to you to stop this from happening.
     To stop this from happening you have to gather information from the passengers or crew, and look for evidence
     that will help you to uncover who is the criminal. "

In your foggy mind you remember you are an Air Marshal, and it is your duty to protect the passengers of the flight.
