### What it is about
You wake up and are dazzled realising that you are on a plane.
As you stare around you start looking in your pockets, in them, you find a badge that reads 'Air Marshal' and a phone.
Upon futher inspection, you find an unread message on your phone that is informing you about a murder that is supposed to take place, 
and it's upon you to gather clues, talk to the passengers and uncover who the 
criminal is. 

### General Game Flow
